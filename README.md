# Odin Recipes

## Overview

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This repository is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) Foundations Course, where I've been working on building a basic recipe website using HTML and CSS. This project serves as an opportunity to practice and strengthen my HTML and CSS skills. The website I've created consists of a main index page with links to various recipes. Please note that the focus of this project is primarily on HTML/CSS, and the visual design may appear simple.

## Project Structure

The project's structure is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main index page of the Odin Recipes website.

- `style`: Directory containing the CSS styles for the website.

- `images`: Directory for storing image assets.

- `README.md`: This README file.
