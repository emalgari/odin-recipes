# odin-recipes

Project recipes:

As part of this project, I created my very first HTML web page.

Using the following steps, I have completed the task;

I have created the “Odin-recipes” repository on Github.com.

This repository was moved onto my local machine using an SSH key by executing the command, "git clone".

To create an organized project, I created separate folders for pages and images.

Each page links to the index.html file, and images link to their corresponding pages.

Using the "style" attribute in the "img" tag, I was able to adjust the image size appropriately.

Through Google, I learned how to make half signs in HTML.

In git, the project is imported into Github using the push command.
